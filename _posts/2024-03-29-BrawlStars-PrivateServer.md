### Introduction
Hey there, guys! It's Abhishek again!! In this tutorial, I'll guide you through the process of creating and playing on your own private server in Brawl Stars using your Android device.

### Requirements
To get started, all you need is an Android phone and a bit of brainpower!

### Downloading the Necessary Files
First, let's download the required files:
- [Download the APK](https://www.mediafire.com/file/biid9ttuhiyeaoi/com.projectbsds.v44226.apk/file) from Mediafire or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zKy632blJDJV7YuBnUZe18Pxpra2lvm5/view?usp=sharing).
- Download the server files from [this GitHub link](https://github.com/CrazorTheCat/BSDS-V44/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). After downloading, extract the files.

### Installation Steps
1. Install the APK on your Android device.
2. Next, download and install the Pydroid app from the Google Play Store.
3. Open the Pydroid app and navigate to where you extracted the server files.
4. Locate the file named **Core.py** and run it.

### Playing the Game
Once you've followed the installation steps:
- Open the Brawl Stars game on your Android device.
- You can now play on your private server, though initially, you'll be playing with bots.
- If you have friends who want to join you, they can follow the same steps and connect to your private server using the same IP address.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If you encounter a "Permission Denied" error when running the Python script, check your device settings to ensure you have permission to run scripts from unknown sources.
- If you have trouble connecting to the server or playing with friends, double-check your network connection and ensure you've entered the correct IP address.
