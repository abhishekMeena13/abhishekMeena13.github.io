# 100 Days of cpp: Can I do it?

Soo guys if you are not living under a rock, then you must know about the trend going on social media called "Hundred days of code". So it's about a challenge where people try to code atleast 1 hour a day for 100 days. It don't matter what language, but you must complete the challenge. I will upload my progress here. Sharing what I learned, day by day. However, I have set some rules for my self.

These are: 
- I must code in javascript or c++.
- If I by chance can't complete the challenge (miss 1 day), then I have to start the challenge with new project.
- That's it.

  If you want to share your progress, use the #100DaysOfCode hashtag on social media.

  I will start my challenge tommorow, aka 1st april 2024 and end on july 10th (hopefully).

  Till tommorow, Abhishek signing off, aideu!
