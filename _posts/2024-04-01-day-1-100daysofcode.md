# Day 1 of 100 days of code!


So, this is the first day of 100 days of code and today is a simple "hello world"!

Technically I  didnt plan to make it, ChatGPT made it!


So, this is so easy!!

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
  cout<<"Hello World!";
}

```
That's it!

Btw i am making a typing speed tester in c++ later today, cuz this was easy.
If i get time then I will also post it!

Till tommorow, Abhishek Signing off, aideu!
